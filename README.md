This project implements J1, ..., JN where the value of N is debatable and everything is called J4.

To setup, `source j4/aliaskit.sh`

Use `jcc <input> <output>` to compile programs

`jcc` has any options to stop and output various stages of compilation which it lists when you invoke it incorrectly.

It also takes a `-d` flag to compile programs with debug output of the execution cycles.
